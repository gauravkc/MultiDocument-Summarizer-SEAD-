Ever since itâ€™s been announced, Iâ€™ve been curious to know why the new Akshay Kumar movie is called Gabbar is Back.
This isnâ€™t a sequel, there wasnâ€™t a movie called Gabbar, so why suggest otherwise?
Although Gabbar (1975) has not made any official comment â€” there are rumours that he was heard laughing manically while rolling around in his grave â€” I represent him and the general, sane public interest with the following enquiries:
Every now and then, a number of films keep popping up with the same subject, so it was no surprise for us when the maker of Gabbar Is Back announced this project, a remake of Tamil flick, Ramana starring Vijaykanth.
The film is directed by one Krish, who presumably also wants to remain anonymous either as a meta homage to the anonymous Gabbar character in the film, or evade the blame for this laughably bad movie.
Cast: Akshay Kumar , Sunil Grover, Shruti Haasan , Suman Talwar and Jaideep Ahlawat;
They have given you pretty much the whole film, including the action scenes, using only GIF images.
